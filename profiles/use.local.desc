sys-devel/gcc:awt - Useful only when building GCJ, this enables Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) peer support on top of GTK+
sys-devel/gcc:cilk - Support the Cilk Plus language (C/C++ based languages for parallel programming)
sys-devel/gcc:d - Enable support for the D programming language
sys-devel/gcc:fixed-point - Enable fixed-point arithmetic support for MIPS targets in gcc (Warning: significantly increases compile time!)
sys-devel/gcc:go - Build the GCC Go language frontend.
sys-devel/gcc:graphite - Add support for the framework for loop optimizations based on a polyhedral intermediate representation
sys-devel/gcc:jit - Enable libgccjit so other applications can embed gcc for Just-In-Time compilation. This will slow down the compiler a bit as it forces all of the toolchain to be shared libs.
sys-devel/gcc:libssp - Build SSP support into a dedicated library rather than use the code in the C library (DO NOT ENABLE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES)
sys-devel/gcc:mpx - Enable support for Intel Memory Protection Extensions (MPX)
sys-devel/gcc:mudflap - Add support for mudflap, a pointer use checking library
sys-devel/gcc:nopie - Disable PIE support (NOT FOR GENERAL USE)
sys-devel/gcc:nossp - Disable SSP support (NOT FOR GENERAL USE)
sys-devel/gcc:objc - Build support for the Objective C code language
sys-devel/gcc:objc++ - Build support for the Objective C++ language
sys-devel/gcc:objc-gc - Build support for the Objective C code language Garbage Collector
sys-devel/gcc:regression-test - Run the testsuite and install the results (requires FEATURES=test)
sys-devel/gcc:sanitize - Build support for various sanitizer functions (ASAN/TSAN/etc...)
sys-devel/gcc:vtv - Build support for virtual table verification (a C++ hardening feature)
